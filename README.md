# Advanced Python Guide


Along my career path, I found a plethora of resources available python tutorials and recomendations for basic python,
but not as many resources for developers looking to push their python skills toward mastery. I have created this guide
as more or less a list of advanced python topics with breif introductions and examples. This definitly is not a replacement
for reading the official docs, but perhaps a starting point for ambitious developers looking for new topics to explore.


Each package represents a different topic. In the most pythonic style possible.
A topic overview and table of contents can be found in each package's __init__.py.
